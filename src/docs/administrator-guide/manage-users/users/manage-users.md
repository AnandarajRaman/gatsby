# Manage Users

New users can be added to the Bold Reports Server individually or in bulk using CSV import

### Add individual users

To add new users to the Bold Reports Server, click on `New User` and then `Create User` from the User Management page.

The `Add User` dialog will be shown as like in the image below.

The activation link sent to the user will be valid only for 2 days and if the user have not activated within the 2 days, a new activation link can be sent to the user from the user edit page. Check [Activate Users](#activate-users) section for more details.

The account will be in inactive status till the user activates the account from the activation email.

To add users with the password, you have to set the Account Activation Mode to `Automatic` in the `Accounts` settings page.
